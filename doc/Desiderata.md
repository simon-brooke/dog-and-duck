*Social media features which users want which [Mastodon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(social_network)) does not provide, or provides poorly.*

1. User-specified inbox-ordering algorithms;
2. Outbox search, by user (i.e. 'find all the times I interacted with x');
3. Outbox search, full text (i.e. 'find the post where I wrote x');
